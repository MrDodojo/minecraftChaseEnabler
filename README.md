# minecraftChaseEnabler
This is a fabric minecraft mod that enables a hidden command in 1.18 experimental snapshot 6 and 7, the mod also backports the client feature to older versions.
Chase is showcased by a Minecraft developer in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg/status/1432375731586277376).

## Requirements
Fabric. No fabric api required
Works in 1.18 snapshots and in some 1.18 experimental snapshots

I recommend turning **/gamerule sendCommandFeedback** to **false** and turning Pause on lost focus off with **F3 + P**
